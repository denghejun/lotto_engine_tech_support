#### Frequently Asked Questions
- Why does it show "Purchase Failed" when I click on the App when I enter the App?
  - Because the App will apply for permission to access the network when you enter it for the first time, sometimes there will be problems, please close the App and reopen it. This is a one-time operation and will not be repeated in the future.
- Why does the engine stutter occasionally?
  - The App uses a real 3D physics engine, which consumes a certain amount of memory, and if the device is running multiple other apps at the same time, there may be a shortage of memory. Please try to close another app before using it
- Why can't I purchase a lifetime membership after subscribing to an auto-renewing membership?
  - Because subscriptions and lifetime purchases unlock all in-app features, you only need to buy any of them by default.
